1. How Web Browsers Function:
Web browsers are like special tools for looking at websites. When you type a website's address or search for something, the browser asks the internet for the web page. 

2. DOM (Document Object Model):
The DOM is like a map for web pages. It shows where everything is on the page, like titles, paragraphs, and pictures. It's a way for computer programs to understand and change what's on the web page. 

3. Difference between HTML, XML, and XHTML:
HTML is a language for making web pages. It's good for showing text and pictures on websites. XML is like a different language for organizing information.

4. Four Essential Elements in HTML Pages:
Every web page needs four important things. The <!DOCTYPE> is like telling the computer which rules to follow. The <html> part is like the main container for everything on the page. The <head> is like notes about the page, and the <body> is like the main story or pictures you see on the website.

5. index.html Page:
An index.html page is like the first page of a book. When you visit a website, it's the page you see first. It helps you start exploring the website by giving you links to other parts.
