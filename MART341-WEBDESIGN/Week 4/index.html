<p>1. How Web Browsers Function:
Web browsers are software that helps you access websites. 
When you type a web address or search, the browser asks the internet for the web page. 
It then shows you the web page on your screen so you can read and interact with it.
</p>
<p>
2. DOM (Document Object Model):
The DOM is like a map for web pages. 
It tells the computer where everything is on the web page, like headings, text, and images. 
This map helps programs understand and change the web page.

3. Difference between HTML, XML, and XHTML:
HTML is a language for making web pages with text and pictures.
 XML is a language for organizing information, like lists or data. 
 XHTML combines the rules of both to make web pages neat and well-structured.
<p>
4. Four Essential Elements in HTML Pages:
Every web page must have four important things. 
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration tells the computer which rules to follow. 
The <html> element is like the main container for everything on the page. 
The <head> section contains notes about the page, and the <body> section holds the main content you see on the website.
</p>
<p>
5. index.html Page:
An index.html page is like the first page of a book. 
When you visit a website, it's the page you see first. 
It helps you start exploring the website by providing links to other parts.

6. Some of the best naming practices include; Not using spaces, to combat this using CamelCase, is a good option. 
 making the names simple and not going too indepth. IE MyPageIsWayTooLong, is not a good name for a folder. 
 You should have, a Pages file, that seperates pages, an images folder, that keeps your images seperate.
 It is imparative to not use spaces or else things get funky. IE how I ended up doing that in this example. 
 The percentage symbols are appearing because I used a space in the naming file. So don't do that, unless you like those symbols.
